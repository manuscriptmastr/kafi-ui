- Auto-focusing elements after moving
- Module mapping with `<script type="importmap"></script>`
- Performant CDNs: Skypack and jsDelivr
- `role="{listbox|option}"`
- Accessible instructions with `aria-describedby`
- Screen readable elements
- Live announcements with `role="alert"` and `aria-live="assertive"`
